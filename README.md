# LaserHell
I created this site in 8th grade (2017) when I was learning JavaScript (and programming in general). It is a [Bullet Hell game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoot_%27em_up#Bullet_hell_and_niche_appeal) with lasers, hence "LaserHell".

## Location
The game is currently hosted through [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com). It can be played at [laserhell.bentone.org](https://laserhell.bentone.org).

## Composition
This game was created with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
